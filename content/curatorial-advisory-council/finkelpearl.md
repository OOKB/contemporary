Tom Finkelpearl is the Executive Director of the Queens Museum of Art where he is working on an expansion that will double the size of the museum. The Queens Museum is situated in America’s most ethnically diverse county, and it seeks to serve as a cultural bridge in the community. He spent 12 years at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center where he organized 15 exhibitions in the 1980’s, returning in 1999 as Deputy Director and working on the organization’s merger with the Museum of Modern Art. Between his P.S.1 stints, he worked for six years (1990-96) as Director of New York City’s Percent for Art Program where he organized over 130 public art projects and as Executive Director of Program at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, a residency program in Maine for advanced visual artists (1996-1999). Based on his public art experience and further research, he published a book, Dialogues in Public Art (MIT Press, 2000). His new book entitled What We Made: Conversations on Art and Social Cooperation (Duke University Press, 2013) examines the activist, participatory, coauthored aesthetic experiences being created in contemporary art. He received a BA from Princeton University (1979) and an MFA from Hunter College (1983).
